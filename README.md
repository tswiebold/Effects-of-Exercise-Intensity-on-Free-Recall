# Effects-of-Exercise-Intensity-on-Free-Recall

As saving time by multitasking has become almost a necessity, research has found that low-intensity exercise can enhance free recall. This study extends the previous research by having participants study word lists during either low-intensity exercise or high-intensity exercise. College students (N = 25) performed squats at a rate of 10 BPM or 100 BPM while studying different word lists followed by walking and guided stretching before recalling the studied words. There was a non-significant trend showing that slightly increased heart rate could enhance memory recall and a greatly increased heart rate could undermine memory recall. There was also a significant correlation predicting that participants who had a higher heart rate were more likely to recall fewer words. Results of this study can be used to manipulate participants heart rates in future research looking at how exercise can affect memory recall.
